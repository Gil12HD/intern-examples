# intern-examples

This repository is a collection of examples of using [Intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern) in web applications.
Use these examples as your guide to integrate [Intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern) into your projects! Every
example has a README that will guide you through the process of setting it up.

The first set of examples have been updated to work with Intern 4, while the others are setup for Intern 3.

## Intern 4 Examples

### Dojo Application

See the `dojo-example` folder and the associated [README](./dojo-example/README.md). This example showcases both unit
tests and functional tests.

### Electron Example

See the `electron-example` folder and the associated [README](./electron-example/README.md). This example showcases
functional tests using both Internâ€™s internal WebDriver API and [Spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron).

### jQuery Application

See `jquery-example` folder and the associated [README](./jquery-example/README.md). This example showcases both unit
tests and functional tests.

### React Application with Enzyme

See `react-enzyme-example` folder and the associated [README](./react-enzyme-example/README.md). This example showcases
both unit tests and functional tests.

### Using Intern with Grunt

See `grunt-example` folder and the associated [README](./grunt-example/README.md). 

## Intern 3 Examples

Each of the examples can be switched from running tests locally to using a cloud testing provider by setting the
relevant [Cloud testing Intern settings](https://theintern.github.io/intern/#hosted-selenium) within the Intern config
for that example.

### Backbone Application

See `backbone-example` folder and the associated README. This example showcases both unit tests and functional tests
that work locally. It is based on the [TodoMVC Backbone Example](http://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/). This example
will generate an HTML code coverage report in the `html-report` directory.

### React Application

See `react-example` folder and the associated README. This example showcases both unit tests and functional tests that
work locally and remotely via Sauce Labs. It is based on the [TodoMVC React
Example](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/).

### Parallel Example
